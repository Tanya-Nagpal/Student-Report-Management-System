- The grade calculation is based on the marks obtained by the student in each subject. The grading scale can be customized within the source code if desired.

- The system assumes valid and appropriate input from the user. Error handling for invalid input is not implemented in this version.

- This is a basic console application and does not include advanced features such as file storage, user authentication, or graphical user interface. It serves as a starting point for further development or as a simple demonstration of student report management.
